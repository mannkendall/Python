# Created October 2020; F.P.A. Vogt; frederic.vogt@alumni.anu.edu.au
# This will build the docs and push them to the gh-pages branch of the repo
# Assumes a few things: 1) docs live in ./docs; 2) there is a doc_build.sh bash script that takes
# the ./docs/source/ material and turn it into a compiled ./docs/build read docs; 3) the content of
# the ./docs/build/ folder are published as-is in a gh-pages branch of the repo, with only
# .nojekyll, .gitignore, and .git (folder) in addition.
